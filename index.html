            <div itemprop="articleBody" class="blog-content">
                <p>The new photo-sharing app called BeReal is not like any other social media platform.
                It's goal and entire brand revolves around authenticity, and trying to limit the 
                'fakeness' most social media platforms like instagram contain. It does this by only 
                allowing users to post a picture once a day at a random time, and will provide you with
                2 minutes to take the picture. There offers no filters or editng features, so what friends
                and other users end up seeing is the real you in your daily life.</p>
                <p>This app is so popular right now because of how it puts everyone on the same level, there 
                are no 'influencers' creating trends or competing for the most followers. It stops people from 
                comparing their own lives to these random influencers who make you think your life is lame in
                comparison and instead lets people focus on their friends lives and their own. </p>
                <p>This simple, realistic feel this app offers is like a breath of fresh air compared to other
                socials, but how long until that freshness no longer appeals to people? How long can simple 
                photos of people honestly capture peoples attention for? There are currently a large lack of 
                typical features most platforms offer such as SMS messaging, groupchats, profile customization,
                looking at old BeReals, etc. This limits the capabilities of the app and how long people can use 
                it for. I personally go on it once a day after I make my post to look through my friends posts. I 
                get that this simplicity is part of the apps brand and purpose, but this stunts the apps growth for 
                future expansions/additions, which makes it, in my opinion, have a short life span. </p>

            <h2 itemprop="headline">Key Design Principles for making a great Municipal Website</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
                <address itemprop="author publisher" class="author">By Joseph Nagy</address>
                <p class="pub-date"><time itemprop="dateCreated datePublished" datetime="2022-06-04" title="June 4th, 2022">June 4th, 2022</time></p>

            </div>
            <div itemprop="articleBody" class="blog-content">
                <p>Municipal Websites are typically, very large and have a lot of content that needs to be
                covered and organized. The most important thing to think about when designing one of these 
                websites is to only display elements that contribute to the <strong>users needs.</strong>
                There are all kinds of different users that visit Municipal sites; government officials, 
                citizens of the township or city, etc. They're purposes for visiting the site may differ,
                but they all most likely are not there to just browse or explore, they are there to find 
                a specific document, form, ordinance, etc. With this in mind, it becomes crucial to make 
                a design that is well structured, navigable, and contains limited visual elements that may
                crowd the user interface.</p>
                <p>I have been designing and building Municipal sites for over a year and have seen a lot of 
                good websites, and a lot of bad websites that are even hard for me to find certain things.
                So, in hopes of helping developers design these websites more effectively, I have compiled a list  
                of design principles for a successful Municipal site:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consistency</strong>&mdash;Designs that change throughout the different pages of a site (or within the page) 
                    end up confusing the user and causing them to feel less familiar/confident in using the interface. 
                    Give users control by designing repeatable patterns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smart Content Organization</strong>&mdash;Organizing content will most likely be the most
                    time consuming part in the design process. Make sure to not overcrowd the navigation with too many 
                    pages, especially if some of those pages are similar enough to be grouped together. It is always a good
                    idea to organize content hierarchically. As the user moves from page to page the more specific the navigation 
                    becomes. For example, the main navigation bar could have an option for 'Departments', and inside 'Departments'
                    are subpages for 'Assessor', 'Treasurer', etc, and inside 'Treasurer' could be a page to pay for property taxes.
                    It is essential to not bombard the user with each specific page that exists on the site in the main navigation bar.</li>
                    <li><strong>Readability</strong>&mdash;Most Municipalities and other Governement Entities are required by law to make 
                    their websites ADA Compliant (Americans with Disabilities Act). This means that websites must offer people with 
                    disabilities access to the same services as anyone else. For example, people with color blindness must be able to 
                    clearly read the text on a website, so there must be sufficient contrast between the text and the background. Also,
                    text must be able to be read from a screen reader so blind individuals are able to get information. Some tips are to 
                    make sure alt text of images are descriptive, use images with text as little as possible (instead add text to markup), 
                    and make sure content is separated clearly with headers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintainability</strong>&mdash;Municipal websites have to be updated often, whether it is adding the latest
                    City Council Minutes or adding an agenda to the announcements, designing a solution to make these updates as easy and as 
                    quick as possible are extremely helpful to people that are making these updates. More than not, the simplist design often 
                    leads to the most maintainable, so next time you have a fun design idea, first think about how to make it easy for others 
                    to understand how it works.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To help your site become ADA Compliant by meeting AA WCAG 2.0 standards, follow the guidelines specified in 
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0&currentsidebar=%23col_customize&levels=a%2Caaa&showtechniques=125" target="_blank">w3.org</a>:</p>
