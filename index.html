            <h3>Why the new 'BeReal' social media is a great concept, but how long will it last?</h2>

                <p>The new photo-sharing app called BeReal is not like any other social media platform.
                It's goal and entire brand revolves around authenticity, and trying to limit the 
                'fakeness' most social media platforms like instagram contain. It does this by only 
                allowing users to post a picture once a day at a random time, and will provide you with
                2 minutes to take the picture. There offers no filters or editng features, so what friends
                and other users end up seeing is the real you in your daily life.</p>
                <p>This app is so popular right now because of how it puts everyone on the same level, there 
                are no 'influencers' creating trends or competing for the most followers. It stops people from 
                comparing their own lives to these random influencers who make you think your life is lame in
                comparison and instead lets people focus on their friends lives and their own. </p>
                <p>This simple, realistic feel this app offers is like a breath of fresh air compared to other
                socials, but how long until that freshness no longer appeals to people? How long can simple 
                photos of people honestly capture peoples attention for? There are currently a large lack of 
                typical features most platforms offer such as SMS messaging, groupchats, profile customization,
                looking at old BeReals, etc. This limits the capabilities of the app and how long people can use 
                it for. I personally go on it once a day after I make my post to look through my friends posts. I 
                get that this simplicity is part of the apps brand and purpose, but this stunts the apps growth for 
                future expansions/additions, which makes it, in my opinion, have a short life span. </p>
